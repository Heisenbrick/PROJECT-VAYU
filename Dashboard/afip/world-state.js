/**
 * AFIP :: World State Engine
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Purpose
 *   Maintain AFIP's single authoritative, immutable understanding of
 *   the aircraft and mission. Nothing bypasses it; every AFIP module
 *   reads the same snapshot per reasoning cycle.
 *
 * Inputs
 *   - Evidence Records from AFIP.EvidenceAdapter, via
 *     AFIP.bus.on('evidence:batch', ...).
 *
 * Outputs
 *   - Immutable World State Snapshot via getSnapshot(), and
 *     AFIP.bus.emit('worldstate:updated', snapshot) each cycle.
 *
 * Dependencies
 *   - Evidence Adapter.
 *
 * Status
 *   IMPLEMENTED (Roadmap Phase 3 — World State).
 *
 * What Phase 3 adds over Phase 2
 *   - The full §5.2–5.13 shape is declared up front (SCHEMA below), so
 *     every module gets an identical, predictable structure from cycle
 *     one — a field that's never been fed by evidence is still present,
 *     just with value: null, not missing.
 *   - Each top-level object (Aircraft, Mission, Navigation, Health, …)
 *     gets a `_meta` block: { dataAvailable, freshness, leafCount }.
 *     `freshness` is "seconds since the most recently updated leaf in
 *     this object, relative to the current cycle's mission clock" —
 *     null if nothing in the object has ever been fed. This is the
 *     concrete form of the "Telemetry Freshness" / "Pose Confidence"
 *     concepts from §5.3, generalized to every object rather than only
 *     Aircraft, since Mission/Navigation need the same honesty check.
 *   - Operator.CurrentCommand is derived (not raw evidence) from
 *     Mission.Status.Playing, matching §5.10: "This object represents
 *     human intent, not aircraft state." It is computed at publish
 *     time from whatever the operator most recently did in the sim UI.
 *
 * What's still NOT here (later phases)
 *   - Health, Energy, Environment, Communication, Risk, Prediction stay
 *     structurally present but empty (`_meta.dataAvailable: false`)
 *     until their owning module (Phase 4) or a real telemetry source
 *     exists. WSE does not synthesize their values — see §5.6 ("Health
 *     ... produced exclusively by the Health Monitoring System") and
 *     §5.11 ("Risk ... generated only by the Risk Engine").
 *   - No reconciliation across conflicting sources — there is only one
 *     evidence source (the simulator) right now.
